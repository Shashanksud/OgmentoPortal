DX setup:
    1)  setting path alias for clean path names while importing any components or module
        added path alias in tsconfig.json and vite.config.js
        installed package "path" as dev dependency

        problem: 
            ts was unable to find types for "path" module

        solution:
            added "@types/node" as dev dependency
            and enabled node types in tsconfig.json
    2)  setting up eslint, prettier, and airbnb ts style guide
        tsconfig.json 
            used by typescript compiler and vscode
            added typescript compiler option rules
            added files/directories in include array to type check
        eslintrc.cjs
          used by eslint and vscode eslint extension to enforce eslint or any configured style guide rules
          added airbnb style guide rule files in extends array
          modified parserOptions for additional configuration
        .prettierrc
            used by prettier vscode extension and prettier
            added .prettierrc config to be used by prettier to format code files
        
        problem: eslint not working after adding rules.
        solution: restart vs code

        problem: ts unable to find types for vite-plugin-eslint
        effects: no effects yet.
        solution: unresolved
